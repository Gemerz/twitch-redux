## TwitchRedux

Following the steps of [soundredux.io](https://github.com/andrewngu/sound-redux). I create this simple client of [Twitch](http://www.twitch.tv/) to learn how Redux works.

Project url [twitchredux.com](http://twitchredux.com/).

Next features:

* Design improvements (Maybe add material-ui design).
* Add the chat iframe next to the video.
* Search feature
* Authentication (Show following channels or games)

Thanks to:

*  [SoundRedux Project](https://github.com/andrewngu/sound-redux). Was an amazing starting point to async calls over redux.
*  [Dan Abramov](https://github.com/gaearon). For all his libraries: [redux] (https://github.com/rackt/redux), [normalizr](https://github.com/gaearon/normalizr) and [redux-devtools](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-devtools).
*  [React Redux Starter Kit](https://github.com/davezuko/react-redux-starter-kit). It's a very good start point.
